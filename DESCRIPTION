Description: Most of the time floating point arithmetic does
  approximately the right thing.  When adding sums or having products of
  numbers that greatly differ in magnitude, the floating point
  arithmetic may be incorrect.  This package implements the Kahan sum,
  Neumaier sum, pairwise-sum (adapted from NumPy), and arbitrary
  precision sum (adapted from Python's fsum).  In addition, products are
  changed to long double precision for accuracy, or changed into a
  log-sum for accuracy.
